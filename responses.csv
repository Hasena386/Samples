Still, this system could be refined.  Students don't have an easy way to submit their work without first deleting the material that has come before.  Student submissions could benefit from a templating system that would automatically include name, date, and other metadata to generate a nicely formatted pdf output, as well as a more tidy ipynb file to include in their submission.","Documentation of nbconvert / slide tools is pretty minimal (for instance, nothing I could find tells you about actually turning on the slide toolbar in the notebook).  nbconvert feels really immature compared to similar behavior we have in RStudio, which has a nice interface support for selecting and customizing templates and controlling file metadata with yaml header blocks, etc.  "

(Details at http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03556). See comment on role of Jupyter in the course in the last question.",,"This is a course to introduce students to Python. We use the Python shell and then Spyder for the majority of the work, and introduce Jupyter towards the end. The purpose of this ordering is to go from simple to more complicated (and powerful). Jupyter notebooks are harder to run and feel confident in than a python shell (for beginners at least this seems to be the case).

Once the Notebook has been introduced we use (and abuse) it to quickly whizz through material that we like the students to have seen and to have access to so they can go through it when required, but don't necessarily need to understand deeply at that moment in time. The notebooks are made available as (executable) reference material, and are a practical way of providing an overview of lots of material that could otherwise  not be covered, and providing the material that the students can work through in a self-paced manner when they need to.

Given this introduction - in which the notebook only starts to feature towards the end of the course -  most students will use the notebook for the duration of their doctoral studies (http://ngcm.soton.ac.uk) that follow this introduction course. ",

Another difficulty is getting everyone on the same page in terms of computational platform; I started using a linux virtual machine that was ready to go, but invariably, some students have trouble with linux installation.

In the next round, I'm most likely going to use the Anaconda Distribution for ease of use.

Yet, our (advanced) classical mechanics course for juniors and seniors is more traditional. Our biggest challenge is to modify the advanced course to more closely couple to our introductory course. One way of meeting that challenge in the future is to use Jupyter VPython. Our students learn VPython in the introductory course. Now they will use Jupyter and VPython. (1.5 years ago, students used iPython Notebook with iVisual in the advanced course, but the software has been updated to Jupyter and VPython.)

Integrated debugging tools (for example, to let students view the current Python environment) would be useful.

It would be nice to allow instructors to publish updates (e.g. bug fixes) to notebooks and merge them with students' edited copies of notebooks.  Git does an okay job, but potentially a tool that understands JSON would be better at merging notebooks.

Collaborative editing would be a great feature."
